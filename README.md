#  Kain Tayo

**Kain Tayo** is a short psychological horror game (1–2 hours) set in a small, Filipino roadside eatery (*kalenderya*). Behind the sizzle of fried garlic rice and the steam rising from *lugaw* pots, something sinister brews. The player assumes the role of a humble food vendor trying to make ends meet — until the familiar routine starts to twist into something unrecognizable.

##  Story Summary

The story unfolds in a small barangay where your eatery has stood for years. Patrons are familiar faces — tricycle drivers, students, factory workers. But after a certain *customer* starts appearing regularly, strange things begin to happen.

Burnt food won't stop burning. Meat sizzles even when raw. Customers speak in loops. The smell of vinegar becomes suffocating. You begin to question: what exactly are you serving? And what are you becoming?

##  Voice Acting

The game will feature full Tagalog voice acting for key NPCs and the protagonist. Voice actors may reprise roles or use similar tones from *Sorbetes: Sa Likod ng Ngiti*, creating a loose thematic connection between the two titles.
